Maximilian Stölzle is a Ph.D. candidate at Delft University of Technology, Netherlands working on modeling and control for continuum soft robots. 
He is visiting the Zardini Lab at MIT in fall 2024 to work on co-designing soft robots.
He received a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering and an M.S. degree with distinction in Mechanical Engineering in 2019 and 2021 respectively both from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, Switzerland.
Previously, he visited the Planetary Robotics Lab at the European Space Agency working on using self-supervised learning for removing occlusions in terrain maps. His research interests center around developing minimalistic models and control strategies (both model-based and data-driven) for soft robots.

Maximilian visited the Zardini lab from September to the end of December 2024.
