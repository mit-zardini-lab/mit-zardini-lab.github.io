Youngseo Kim is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UCLA. 
Her lab focuses on solving design and operational problems in complex, interconnected systems in transportation and logistics, with a particular emphasis on human behavior.

Prior to joining UCLA, she completed her Ph.D. at Cornell University, specializing in Transportation Engineering advised by Samitha Samaranayake. Youngseo's research foundation is built in discrete optimization, discrete choice modeling, and reinforcement learning, with a keen interest in Mobility-on-Demand services and Mobility-as-a-Service systems. Recent endeavors include developing large-scale vehicle dispatching and routing algorithms. Additionally, Youngseo Kim is delving into the analytical integration of discrete choice modeling in optimization across diverse applications. Before joining Cornell, Youngseo Kim pursued an M.S. at Seoul National University (SNU), mentored by Dong-Kyu Kim, and specialized in discrete choice analysis and machine learning. Youngseo Kim holds a B.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering from SNU, conferred in 2018.

In the context of her collaboration with Zardini Lab, Youngseo is working on strategic interactions and demand modeling in mobility systems.
