Marius earned his master's degree in Interdisciplinary Sciences at ETH, focusing on Biological Chemistry. Thinking about the organizational principles of life sparked a deep interest in Mathematics, which he pursued during a second bachelor's degree at the University of Zurich. 
Currently, he is using probabilistic programming, Bayesian statistics and Category Theory to develop high-level modeling tools that will help Biologists translate their conceptual understanding into computable structures.

Marius visited the Zardini lab from September to the end of December 2024.
