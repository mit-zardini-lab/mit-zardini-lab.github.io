Dr. Daniele Gammelli is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Autonomous Systems Lab at Stanford University and a Research Fellow at the Center for Aerospace Autonomy Research at Stanford (CAESAR) and the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford (CARS), supported by NASA and Blue Origin. He received his Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Mathematical Optimization from the Department of Technology, Management and Economics at the Technical University of Denmark. Dr. Gammelli's research focuses on developing the algorithmic foundations and system-level methodologies that enable AI-powered autonomous systems to operate safely, efficiently, and reliably in high-stakes environments, with an emphasis on aerospace autonomy and next-generation mobility systems. His Ph.D. thesis was nominated for DTU’s PhD Thesis of the Year and DTU’s Young Researcher Award, and he is a recipient of the Kaj and Hermilla Ostenfeld Excellence Research Award.

In the context of his collaboration with the Zardini Lab, Daniele is working on coordination algorithms for multi-agent systems.
