Riccardo is a second-year Master of Science in Transportation and incoming Ph.D. student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), with a diverse academic background spanning an Aerospace Engineering title, a BSc in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, and an MSc in Data Science. His professional experiences at UNSW Hyperloop, the Swiss Federal Railways, and Continuum Industries have shaped his research interests in the quantification and optimization of equitable urban mobility systems. His prior work includes applying deep reinforcement learning for equitable network design, while his current research at MITâ€™s JTL-TransitLab under Professor Jinhua Zhao focuses on rail platform crowd prediction and propagation. 
In the Zardini Lab, Riccardo aims to advance equity-driven co-design of urban mobility systems by integrating stakeholder perspectives into algorithmic frameworks.
