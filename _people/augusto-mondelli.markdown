Augusto Mondelli is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Robotics, Systems, and Control at ETH Zurich and received his Bachelor’s degree in Automation Engineering from Politecnico di Milano in 2023. His research interests lie at the intersection of robotics, control, machine learning, and planning. Prior to joining MIT, he was a research assistant at the Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control at ETH Zurich within Prof. Emilio Frazzoli’s group, where he worked on the development of an automated testing framework for autonomous-vehicle planning algorithms. 

At the Zardini Lab at MIT, his research focuses on the control of multi-agent autonomous systems, combining optimization-based and data-driven approaches.
