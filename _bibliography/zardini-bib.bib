abstract={Increasing urbanization and exacerbation of sustainability goals threaten the operational efficiency of current transportation systems and confront cities
with complex choices with huge impact on future generations. At the same time, the rise of private, profit-maximizing Mobility Service Providers leveraging
public resources, such as ride-hailing companies, entangles current regulation schemes. This calls for tools to study such complex socio-technical problems.
In this paper, we provide a game-theoretic framework to study interactions between stakeholders of the mobility ecosystem, modeling regulatory aspects such
as taxes and public transport prices, as well as operational matters for Mobility Service Providers such as pricing strategy, fleet sizing, and vehicle design.
Our framework is modular and can readily accommodate different types of Mobility Service Providers, actions of municipalities, and low-level models of customers
choices in the mobility system. Through both an analytical and a numerical case study for the city of Berlin, Germany, we showcase the ability of our framework
to compute equilibria of the problem, to study fundamental tradeoffs, and to inform stakeholders and policy makers on the effects of interventions.
Among others, we show tradeoffs between customers satisfaction, environmental impact, and public revenue, as well as the impact of strategic decisions
on these metrics.},

While individual lenses have been widely used in applications, many of the mathematical properties of the corresponding categories of lenses have remained unknown.
In this paper, we study the category of small categories and asymmetric delta lenses, and prove that it has several good exactness properties.
These properties include the existence of certain limits and colimits, as well as so-called imported limits, such as imported products and imported pullbacks, which have arisen previously in applications.
The category is also shown to be extensive, and it has an image factorisation system.},

  abstract={Modern applications require robots to comply with multiple, often conflicting rules and to interact with the other agents.
  We present Posetal Games as a class of games in which each player expresses a preference over the outcomes via a partially ordered set of metrics.
  This allows one to combine hierarchical priorities of each player with the interactive nature of the environment.
  By contextualizing standard game theoretical notions, we provide two sufficient conditions on the preference of the players to prove existence of pure Nash Equilibria in finite action sets.
  Moreover, we define formal operations on the preference structures and link them to a refinement of the game solutions, showing how the set of equilibria can be systematically shrunk.
  The presented results are showcased in a driving game where autonomous vehicles select from a finite set of trajectories.
  The results demonstrate the interpretability of results in terms of minimum-rank-violation for each player.},

title={Categorification of Negative Information using Enrichment},
author={Censi, Andrea and Frazzoli, Emilio and Lorand, Jonathan and Zardini, Gioele},
abstract={In many engineering applications it is useful to reason about "negative information". For example, in planning problems, providing an optimal solution is the same as giving a feasible solution (the "positive" information) together with a proof of the fact that there cannot be feasible solutions better than the one given (the "negative" information). We model negative information by introducing the concept of "norphisms", as opposed to the positive information of morphisms. A "nategory" is a category that has "nom"-sets in addition to hom-sets, and specifies the interaction between norphisms and morphisms. In particular, we have composition rules of the form morphism + norphism → norphism. Norphisms do not compose by themselves; rather, they use morphisms as catalysts. After providing several applied examples, we connect nategories to enriched category theory. Specifically, we prove that categories enriched in de Paiva's dialectica categories GC, in the case C = Set and equipped with a modified monoidal product, define nategories which satisfy additional regularity properties. This formalizes negative information categorically in a way that makes negative and positive morphisms equal citizens.},

  We propose to use a biology-inspired approach, which we term the bilinear optic flow approximation, that is more computationally efficient. 
  We build on previous work that has shown that the bilinear approximation can be used for visual servoing. 
  Here, we show that a bilinear approximator can be learned that is able to stabilize the heading of a robot while performing continuous forward motion in a corridor-shaped environment. 
  This is a necessary capability for confined-space navigation that insect-sized robots are likely to perform. 
  In this work, we describe the underlining methodology of the method and built a 2D visual simulation environment and omnidirectional camera model to validate our results.},

abstract={The evolution of existing transportation systems, mainly driven by urbanization and increased availability of mobility options, such as private, profit-maximizing ride-hailing companies, calls for tools to reason about their design and regulation.
To study this complex sociotechnical problem, one needs to account for the strategic interactions of the heterogeneous stakeholders involved in the mobility ecosystem and analyze how they influence the system.
In this paper, we focus on the interactions between citizens who compete for the limited resources of a mobility system to complete their desired trip. 
Specifically, we present a game-theoretic framework for multi-modal mobility systems, where citizens, characterized by heterogeneous preferences, have access to various mobility options and seek individually-optimal decisions.
We study the arising game and prove the existence of an equilibrium, which can be efficiently computed via a convex optimization problem.
Through both an analytical and a numerical case study for the classic scenario of Sioux Falls, USA, we illustrate the capabilities of our model and perform sensitivity analyses.
Importantly, we show how to embed our framework into an "larger" game among stakeholders of the mobility ecosystem (e.g., municipality, Mobility Service Providers (MSPs), and citizens), effectively giving rise to tools to inform strategic interventions and policy-making in the mobility ecosystem.},

abstract={Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) offer a sustainable alternative to Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs).
This paper addresses some of the challenges faced by the automotive industry and the scientific community in defining the technology for the next generation of automotive power converters. 
The focus is on achieving reduced CO2 emissions, improved energy efficiency, and reliability, while minimizing costs to enable large-scale adoption of BEVs and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). 
The paper leverages an automotive converter equipped with the recently developed Adjustable Hybrid Switch (AHS) based electric gear and proposes a reliability-based control algorithm for operating the converter E-Gear (EG) of BEVs. 
By integrating reliability control principles, the proposed algorithm minimizes system damage over time and enhances the converter's lifetime. 
The case studies, based on standardised driving cycles, demonstrate the benefits of the presented approach in terms of energy losses and lifetime expectations.
Overall, this work contributes a novel approach to drivetrain control in BEVs, highlighting the potential of the proposed control strategy to improve energy efficiency and reliability. 
The research findings provide valuable insights for the development of next-generation automotive power converters.},

  abstract= {The contemporary era struggles with the intricate challenge of designing “complex systems”. These systems
  are characterized by intricate webs of interactions that interlace their components, giving rise to multifaceted
  complexities, springing from at least two sources.
  First, the co-design of complex systems (e.g., a large network of cyber-physical systems) demands the
  simultaneous selection of heterogeneous components (e.g., hardware vs. software parts), while satisfying
  system constraints and accounting for multiple objectives. Second, different components are interconnected
  through interactions, and their design cannot be decoupled (e.g., within a mobility system).
  Navigating this complexity necessitates innovative approaches, and this thesis responds to this imperative
  by focusing on the theory of co-design. Our exploration extends from the design of individual platforms,
  such as autonomous vehicles, to the orchestration of entire mobility systems built upon such platforms. In
  particular, we delve into the theoretical foundations of a monotone theory of co-design, establishing a robust
  mathematical framework, leveraging category theory to elucidate key concepts, including compositionality
  and functorial solution schemes in co-design.
  Notably, this thesis offers not only an understanding of the theoretical underpinnings, but also practical
  guidance for applying them to a diverse array of real-world problems, revolving around the domain of
  embodied intelligence. The presented toolbox empowers efficient computation of optimal design solutions
  tailored to specific tasks and, in its novelty, paves the way for several possibilities for future research.},

title={Compositional Design of Autonomous Systems: From Hardware Selection to Decision Making},
author={Zardini, Gioele},
booktitle ={26th International Symposium on Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems},
abstract={When designing autonomous systems, we need to consider multiple trade-offs at various abstraction levels, and choices of single (hardware and software) components need to be studied jointly. For instance, the design of future mobility solutions (e.g., autonomous vehicles) and the design of the mobility systems they enable are closely coupled. Indeed, knowledge about the intended service of novel mobility solutions would impact their design and deployment process, whilst insights about their technological development could significantly affect transportation policies.
Co-designing autonomous systems is a complex task for at least two reasons. First, the co-design of interconnected systems (e.g., networks of cyber-physical systems) involves the simultaneous choice of components arising from heterogeneous fields, while satisfying systemic constraints and accounting for multiple objectives. Second, components are connected via interactions between different stakeholders. I will present a framework to co-design such systems, leveraging a monotone theory of co-design. The framework will be instantiated in applications in mobility and autonomy. Through various case studies, I will show how the proposed approaches allow one to efficiently answer heterogeneous questions, unifying different modeling techniques and promoting interdisciplinarity, modularity, and compositionality. I will then discuss open challenges for compositional systems design optimization.},

title={Functor String Diagrams: A Novel Approach to Flexible Diagrams for Applied Category Theory},
author={Abbott, Vincent and Zardini, Gioele},
abstract={The study of abstraction and composition - the focus of category theory - naturally leads to sophisticated diagrams which can encode complex algebraic semantics. 
Consequently, these diagrams facilitate a clearer visual comprehension of diverse theoretical and applied systems.
Complex algebraic structures---otherwise represented by a forest of symbols---can be encoded into diagrams with intuitive graphical rules. 
The prevailing paradigm for diagrammatic category theory are monoidal string diagrams whose specification reflects the axioms of monoidal categories. 
However, such diagrams struggle in accurately portraying crucial categorical constructs such as functors or natural transformations, obscuring central concepts such as the Yoneda lemma or the simultaneous consideration of hom-functors and products.
In this work, we introduce \emph{functor string diagrams}, a systematic approach for the development of categorical diagrams which allows functors, natural transformations, and products to be clearly represented. 
We validate their practicality in multiple dimensions. 
We show their usefulness for theoretical manipulations by proving the Yoneda lemma, show that they encompass monoidal string diagrams and hence their helpful properties, and end by showing their exceptional applied utility by leveraging them to underpin neural circuit diagrams, a method which, at last, allows deep learning architectures to be comprehensively and rigorously expressed.},

title={Diagrammatic Negative Information},
author={Abbott, Vincent and Zardini, Gioele},
abstract={The flow of information through a complex system can be readily understood with category theory. 
However, negative information (e.g., what is \textit{not }possible) does not have an immediately evident categorical representation. 
The formalization of nategories using unconventional composition addresses this issue, and lets imposed limitations on categories be considered. 
However, traditional nategories abandon core categorical constructs and rely on extensive mathematical development. This creates a divide between the consideration of positive and negative information composition. 
In this work, we show that negative information can be considered in a natural categorical manner. This is aided by functor string diagrams, a novel flexible diagrammatic approach that can intuitively show the operation of hom-functors and natural transformations in expressions. This insight reveals how to consider the composition of negative information with foundational categorical constructs without relying on enrichment.
We present diagrammatic means to consider not only nategories, but preorders more broadly. 
This paper introduces diagrammatic methods for the consideration of triangle inequalities and co-designs $\displaystyle \mathbf{DP/Feas_{Bool}}$, showing how important cases of negative information composition can be categorically and diagrammatically approached. 
In particular, we develop systematic tools to rigorously consider imposed limitations on systems, advancing our mathematical understanding, and present intuitive diagrams which motivate widespread adoption and usage for various applications.},

title={Integrated User Matching and Pricing in Round-Trip Car-Sharing},
author={Singh Brar, Avalpreet and Su, Rong and Zardini, Gioele and Kaur, Jaskaranveer},
abstract={Traditional round-trip car rental systems mandate users to return vehicles to their point of origin, limiting the system’s adaptability to meet diverse mobility demands. 
This constraint often leads to fleet under-utilization and incurs high parking costs for idle vehicles. 
To address this inefficiency, we propose a N-user matching algorithm which is designed to facilitate one-way trips within the round-trip rental framework. Our algorithm addresses the joint problem of optimal pricing and user matching through a Two-Stage Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based formulation. 
In the first stage, optimal rental prices are determined by setting a risk factor that governs the likelihood of matching a set of N-user. The second stage involves maximizing expected profit through a novel ILP-based user-matching formulation. Testing our algorithm on real-world scenarios demonstrates an approximate 35\% increase in demand fulfillment. Additionally, we assess the model’s robustness under uncertainty by varying factors such as the risk factor (probability of user’s ride acceptance at the offered price), cost factor (rental cost-to-fare ratio), and maximum chain length.},

Due to the high complexity of the system, the possibilities to increase efficiency and thus enhance performance in many different subsystems are integral part of a successful vehicle. This research presents a novel multi-objective optimization approach based on applied category theory, which tackles the interdisciplinarity arising from multiple physical subsystems as well as strategic decisions. We first analyze lap-specific aspects and show optimal implementations for the choice of crucial components of a hybrid electric powertrain in racing application. Key objectives include minimizing lap time and short-term component wear, by selecting the optimal components and choosing maximum power deployment. Our op- timization results demonstrate significant differences in optimal configuration depending on track characteristics. Then, we raise the level of abstraction and extend the framework to a race scenario, where we include strategic aspects of the competition by means of data-based models and optimization results. The goals are minimizing race time and component wear, while considering energy allocation strategies, pit stops and uncertainties that might occur. By means of a case study we show the influence of a successful qualifying session on the race strategy and therefore component wear. This study provides a foundational framework for future advancements in racing strategy, advocating continued innovation and adoption within the racing industry.},

abstract= {Optimizing deep learning algorithms currently requires slow, manual derivation, potentially leaving much performance untapped.
  Methods like FlashAttention have achieved a $\times 6$ performance improvement over native PyTorch by avoiding unnecessary data transfers, but required three iterations over three years.
  Automated compiled methods have consistently lagged behind.
  GPUs are limited by both transfers to processors and available compute, with transfer bandwidth having improved at a far slower pace.
  Already, transfer bandwidth accounts for 46\% of GPU energy costs.
  This indicates the future of energy and capital-efficient algorithms relies on improved consideration of transfer costs (IO-awareness) and a systematic method for deriving optimized algorithms.
  In this paper, we present a diagrammatic approach to deep learning models which, with simple relabelings, derive optimal implementations and performance models that consider low-level memory.
  Diagrams generalize down the GPU hierarchy, providing a universal performance model for comparing hardware and quantization choices.
  Diagrams generate pseudocode, which reveals the application of hardware-specific features such as coalesced memory access, tensor core operations, and overlapped computation.

This study focuses on achieving company-traveler equilibria, whereby a single company optimizes pricing and routing decisions to maximize profitability while considering travelers’ mode choices, modeled via a multinomial logit model (MNL). 
  Although profit maximization problems have been extensively studied in the field of revenue management across various domains, their application to transportation networks poses unique challenges, such as the influence of network topology and additional constraints (e.g., flow conservation, rebalancing, etc.).
  To address the inherent non-linear relationship arising from endogenous travel demand, we shift our domain space from price to market share. Subsequently, we derive prices using a direct one-to-one correspondence within the MNL. 
  This work is the first effort in leveraging such novel techniques in the context of transportation network analysis. 
  Remarkably, the proposed reformulation results in an equivalent problem exhibiting convexity, offering computational efficiency and interpretability. 
  By solving the KKT conditions, we characterize user equilibrium with the generalized route cost, which incorporates the operating cost by rebalancing and travelers’ disutility caused by congestion. 
  Our approach is empirically validated through a numerical analysis conducted on the widely recognized Sioux Falls network. The results underscore the effectiveness and practical applicability of our method in analyzing transportation networks featuring MoD services, and opens the stage for important future investigations.},

abstract={Ride hailing systems suffer from spatial-temporal supply demand imbalance due to drivers operating in independent, and uncoordinated manner. 
Several fleet rebalancing models have been proposed that can provide repositioning recommendations to idle standing drivers with the objective of maximizing service rate or minimizing customer waiting time. Existing models assume complete adherence by the drivers which leads to limited practical implementation of these models. A novel taxi rebalancing model and a procedure to compute recommendations for repositioning of taxis are proposed which accounts for uncertainties in adherence arising from taxi driver's preferences and the evolving confidence of the driver in the system due to outcomes of repositioning recommendations. Extensive simulations using NYC taxi dataset showed that the proposed model can lead to 6.3\% higher allocation rates, 11.8\% higher driver profits, 4.5\% higher demand fulfillment, and 14\% higher confidence of drivers in the rebalancing system, as compared to a state-of-the-art rebalancing model that is agnostic to the taxi driver preferences and confidence in the system.},

abstract={Effective trajectory generation is essential for reliable on-board spacecraft autonomy. Among other approaches, learning-based warm-starting represents an appealing paradigm for solving the trajectory generation problem, effectively combining the benefits of optimization- and data-driven methods. Current approaches for learning-based trajectory generation often focus on fixed, single-scenario environments, where key scene characteristics, such as obstacle positions or final-time requirements, remain constant across problem instances.
However, practical trajectory generation requires the scenario to be frequently reconfigured, making the single-scenario approach a potentially impractical solution. To address this challenge, we present a novel trajectory generation framework that generalizes across diverse problem configurations, by leveraging high-capacity transformer neural networks capable of learning from multimodal data sources. Specifically, our approach integrates transformer-based neural network models into the trajectory optimization process, encoding both scene-level information (e.g., obstacle locations, initial and goal states) and trajectory-level constraints (e.g., time bounds, fuel consumption targets) via multimodal representations.
The transformer network then generates near-optimal initial guesses for non-convex optimization problems, significantly enhancing convergence speed and performance. The framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a free-flyer platform, achieving up to 30\% cost improvement and 80\% reduction in infeasible cases with respect to traditional approaches, and demonstrating robust generalization across diverse scenario variations.},

Network-based complex systems are inherently interconnected, with the design and performance of subnetworks being interdependent. 
However, the decisions of self-interested operators may lead to suboptimal outcomes for users.
In this paper, we consider the question of what cooperative mechanisms can benefit both operators and users simultaneously.  
We address this question in a game theoretical setting, integrating both non-cooperative and cooperative game theory. 
During the non-cooperative stage, subnetwork decision-makers strategically design their local networks. 
In the cooperative stage, the co-investment mechanism and the payoff-sharing mechanism are developed to enlarge collective benefits and fairly distribute them. 
A case study of the Sioux Falls network is conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework. The impact of this interactive network design on environmental sustainability, social welfare and economic efficiency is evaluated, along with an examination of scenarios involving regions with heterogeneous characteristics.

abstract={The travel demand forecasting model plays a crucial role in evaluating large-scale infrastructure projects, such as the construction of new roads or transit lines. While combined modeling approaches have been explored as a solution to overcome the problem of input/output discrepancies in a sequential four-step modeling process, previous attempts at combined models have encountered challenges in real-world applications, primarily due to their limited behavioral richness or computational tractability. In this study, we propose a novel convex programming approach and present a key theorem demonstrating that the produced optimal solution coincides with the one arising from the hierarchical extended logit model. This model is specifically designed to capture correlations existing in travelers' choices, including similarities among transport modes and route overlaps. The convex property of our model ensures the existence of solutions and naturally offers computational efficiency. The advantages of our proposed model are twofold. First, it provides a single unifying rationale (i.e., utility/entropy maximization) that is valid across all steps. Second, its combined nature allows one to systematically handle observed data, enabling a better representation of reality. Our convex programming approach shows promise in enhancing the accuracy and applicability of travel demand forecasting, thereby aiding in the decision-making processes for infrastructure projects.},

  abstract= {Applied category theory often studies symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs) whose morphisms represent open systems.
  These structures naturally accommodate complex wiring patterns, leveraging (co)monoidal structures for splitting and merging wires, or compact closed structures for feedback. 
  A key example is the compact closed SMC of design problems ($\DP$), which enables a compositional approach to co-design in engineering.
  However, in practice, the systems of interest may not be fully known.
  Recently, Markov categories have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling uncertain processes. 
  In this work, we demonstrate how to integrate this perspective into the study of open systems while preserving consistency with the underlying SMC structure.
  To this end, we employ the change-of-base construction for enriched categories, replacing the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal $\V$-category $\C$ with parametric maps $A \to \C(X,Y)$ in a Markov category induced by a symmetric monoidal monad. 
  This results in a symmetric monoidal 2-category $N_*\C$ with the same objects as $\C$ and reparametrization 2-cells.

author={Milojevic, Dejan and Zardini, Gioele and Elser, Mirian and Censi, Andrea and Frazzoli, Emilio},
abstract={This paper discusses the integration challenges and strategies for designing mobile robots, by focusing on the task-driven, optimal selection of hardware and software to balance safety, efficiency, and minimal usage of resources such as costs, energy, computational requirements, and weight. We emphasize the interplay between perception and motion planning in decision-making, leveraging False Negative Rate (FNR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) to evaluate sensor and algorithm performance under various factors such as geometric relationships, object properties, sensor resolution, and environmental conditions. We introduce the concept of occupancy queries to quantify the perception requirements for sampling-based motion planners, and propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach for efficient sensor and algorithm selection and placement. This forms the basis for a co-design optimization that includes the robot body, motion planner, perception pipeline, and computing unit. A case study on developing an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) for urban scenarios provides actionable information for designers, and shows that complex tasks escalate resource demands, with task performance affecting choices of the autonomy stack. The study demonstrates that resource prioritization influences sensor choice: cameras are preferred for cost-effective and lightweight designs, while lidar sensors are chosen for better energy and computational efficiency.},

    Rapid urbanization has led to a surge of customizable mobility demand in urban areas, which makes on-demand services increasingly popular. On-demand services are flexible while reducing the need for private cars, thus mitigating congestion and parking issues in limited urban space. While the coordination of high-capacity ridepooling on-demand service requires effective control to ensure efficiency, the emergence of the paradigm of robo-taxi opens the opportunity for centralized fleet control for an improved service quality. 
    In this work, we propose two acceleration algorithms for the most advanced large-scale high-capacity algorithm.

    We present a novel algorithm for large-scale Multi-Agent Path Finding that enables fast, scalable planning in dynamic environments such as automated warehouses.
Our approach introduces finite-horizon hierarchical factorization, a framework that plans one step at a time in a receding-horizon fashion.
Robots first compute individual plans in parallel, and then dynamically group based on spatio-temporal conflicts and reachability.
The framework accounts for conflict resolution, and for immediate execution and concurrent planning, significantly reducing response time compared to offline algorithms.
Experimental results on benchmark maps demonstrate that our method achieves up to 60\% reduction in time-to-first-action while consistently delivering high-quality solutions, outperforming state-of-the-art offline baselines across a range of problem sizes and planning horizons.

  abstract= {
    How do we enable artificial intelligence models to improve themselves? This is central to exponentially improving generalized artificial intelligence models, which can improve their own architecture to handle new problem domains in an efficient manner that leverages the latest hardware. However, current automated compilation methods are poor, and efficient algorithms require years of human development. In this paper, we use neural circuit diagrams, based in category theory, to prove a general theorem related to deep learning algorithms, guide the development of a novel attention algorithm catered to the domain of gene regulatory networks, and produce a corresponding efficient kernel. The algorithm we propose, spherical attention, shows that neural circuit diagrams enable a principled and systematic method for reasoning about deep learning architectures and providing high-performance code. By replacing SoftMax with an $L^2$ norm as suggested by diagrams, it overcomes the special function unit bottleneck of standard attention while retaining the streaming property essential to high-performance. Our diagrammatically derived \textit{FlashSign} kernel achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, fine-tuned FlashAttention algorithm on an A100, and $3.6\times$ the performance of PyTorch. Overall, this investigation shows neural circuit diagrams' suitability as a high-level framework for the automated development of efficient, novel artificial intelligence architectures.

  abstract= {
    This paper presents the Maximal Compatibility Matching (MCM) framework, a novel assignment strategy for ride-hailing systems that explicitly incorporates passenger comfort into the matching process. 
Traditional assignment methods prioritize spatial efficiency, but often overlook behavioral alignment between passengers and drivers, which can significantly impact user satisfaction. 
MCM addresses this gap by learning personalized passenger comfort zones using gradient-boosted decision tree classifiers trained on labeled ride data, and by modeling driver behavior through empirical operating profiles constructed from time-series driving features. 
Compatibility between a passenger and a driver is computed as the closed-form volume of intersection between their respective feature-space regions. 
These compatibility scores are integrated into a utility-based matching algorithm that balances comfort and proximity through a tunable trade-off parameter. 
We validate the framework using a Unity-based driving simulator with real-time passenger feedback, demonstrating that MCM enables more personalized and socially acceptable matchings while maintaining high levels of operational performance.

    Traditional rebalancing methods in ride-hailing systems direct idle drivers to fixed destinations, overlooking the fact that ride allocations frequently occur while cruising.
This destination-centric view fails to exploit the path-dependent nature of modern platforms, where real-time matching depends on the entire trajectory rather than a static endpoint.
We propose the Wise Goose Chase (WGC) algorithm, an event-triggered, driver-specific path planning framework that anticipates future matching opportunities by forecasting spatio-temporal supply and demand dynamics.
WGC uses a system of Retarded Functional Differential Equations (RFDEs) to model the evolution of idle driver density and passenger queues at the road-segment level, incorporating both en-route matching and competition among drivers.
Upon request, WGC computes personalized cruising paths that minimize each driver's expected time to allocation.
Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic urban networks show that WGC consistently outperforms baseline strategies, highlighting the advantage of predictive, context-aware rebalancing in dynamic mobility systems.

  abstract= {Soft robots promise inherent safety via their material compliance for seamless interactions with humans or delicate environments. Yet, their development is challenging because it requires integrating materials, geometry, actuation, and autonomy into complex mechatronic systems. Despite progress, the field struggles to balance task-specific performance with broader factors like durability and manufacturability—a difficulty that we find is compounded by traditional sequential design processes with their lack of feedback loops. 
  In this perspective, we review emerging co-design approaches that simultaneously optimize the body and brain, enabling the discovery of unconventional designs highly tailored to the given tasks. We then identify three key shortcomings that limit the broader adoption of such co-design methods within the soft robotics domain.
  First, many rely on simulation-based evaluations focusing on a single metric, while real-world designs must satisfy diverse criteria. Second, current methods emphasize computational modeling without ensuring feasible realization, risking sim-to-real performance gaps. Third, high computational demands limit the exploration of the complete design space. Finally, we propose a holistic co-design framework that addresses these challenges by incorporating a broader range of design values, integrating real-world prototyping to refine evaluations, and boosting efficiency through surrogate metrics and model-based control strategies. This holistic framework, by simultaneously optimizing functionality, durability, and manufacturability, has the potential to enhance reliability and foster broader acceptance of soft robotics, transforming human-robot interactions.},

    Robots operating alongside people, particularly in sensitive scenarios such as aiding the elderly with daily tasks or collaborating with workers in manufacturing, must guarantee safety and cultivate user trust. Continuum soft manipulators promise safety through material compliance, but as designs evolve for greater precision, payload capacity, and speed, and increasingly incorporate rigid elements, their injury risk resurfaces. In this letter, we introduce a comprehensive High-Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) + High-Order Control Lyapunov Function (HOCLF) framework that enforces strict contact force limits across the entire soft-robot body during environmental interactions. Our approach combines a differentiable Piecewise Cosserat-Segment (PCS) dynamics model with a convex-polygon distance approximation metric, named Differentiable Conservative Separating Axis Theorem (DCSAT), based on the soft robot geometry to enable real-time, whole-body collision detection, resolution, and enforcement of the safety constraints. By embedding HOCBFs into our optimization routine, we guarantee safety and actively regulate environmental coupling, allowing, for instance, safe object manipulation under HOCLF-driven motion objectives. Extensive planar simulations demonstrate that our method maintains safety-bounded contacts while achieving precise shape and taskspace regulation. This work thus lays a foundation for the deployment of soft robots in human-centric environments with provable safety and performance.

  year={2025},
  abstract= {Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL), where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to model preferences beyond expected return. 
  Recent extensions to multi-agent RL (MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness to uncertainty.
  In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can promote cooperation.
  Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice, are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding.
  Building on the dual representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism.
  We introduce optimistic value functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking evaluations.
  Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic algorithms that implement these updates.
  Empirical results on cooperative benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
  Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in MARL.

    Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, powered by advances in robotics, control, and Machine Learning (ML), offer a promising paradigm for future urban transportation. AMoD offers fast and personalized travel services by leveraging centralized control of autonomous vehicle fleets to optimize operations and enhance service performance. However, the rapid growth of this field has outpaced the development of standardized practices for evaluating and reporting results, leading to significant challenges in reproducibility. As AMoD control algorithms become increasingly complex and data-driven, a lack of transparency in modeling assumptions, experimental setups, and algorithmic implementation hinders scientific progress and undermines confidence in the results. This paper presents a systematic study of reproducibility in AMoD research. We identify key components across the research pipeline, spanning system modeling, control problems, simulation design, algorithm specification, and evaluation, and analyze common sources of irreproducibility. We survey prevalent practices in the literature, highlight gaps, and propose a structured framework to assess and improve reproducibility. Specifically, concrete guidelines are offered, along with a "reproducibility checklist", to support future work in achieving replicable, comparable, and extensible results. While focused on AMoD, the principles and practices we advocate generalize to a broader class of cyber-physical systems that rely on networked autonomy and data-driven control. This work aims to lay the foundation for a more transparent and reproducible research culture in the design and deployment of intelligent mobility systems.

  abstract= {
    Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) services offer an opportunity for improving passenger service while reducing pollution and energy consumption through effective vehicle coordination. A primary challenge in the autonomous fleets coordination is to tackle the inherent issue of supply-demand imbalance. A key strategy in resolving this is vehicle rebalancing, strategically directing idle vehicles to areas with anticipated future demand. Traditional research focuses on deterministic optimization using specific demand forecasts, but the unpredictable nature of demand calls for methods that can manage this uncertainty. This paper introduces the Deep Uncertainty Robust Optimization (DURO), a framework specifically designed for vehicle rebalancing in AMoD systems amidst uncertain demand based on neural networks for robust optimization. DURO forecasts demand uncertainty intervals using a deep neural network, which are then integrated into a robust optimization model. We assess DURO against various established models, including deterministic optimization with refined demand forecasts and Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). Based on real-world data from New York City (NYC), our findings show that DURO surpasses traditional deterministic models in accuracy and is on par with DRO, but with superior computational efficiency. The DURO framework is a promising approach for vehicle rebalancing in AMoD systems that is proven to be effective in managing demand uncertainty, competitive in performance, and more computationally efficient than other optimization models.

  abstract= {
    Network-based systems are inherently interconnected, with the design and performance of subnetworks being interdependent. However, the decisions of self-interested operators may lead to suboptimal outcomes for users and the system as a whole.  
This paper explores cooperative mechanisms that can simultaneously benefit both operators and users. 
We address this challenge using a game-theoretical framework that integrates both non-cooperative and cooperative game theory. 
In the non-cooperative stage, we propose a network design game in which subnetwork decision-makers strategically design their local infrastructures. 
In the cooperative stage, co-investment with payoff-sharing mechanism is developed to enlarge collective benefits and fairly distribute them, supporting cooperative decision-making within a competitive environment.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct case studies on the Sioux Falls network and real-world public transportation networks in Zurich and Winterthur, Switzerland. 
Our evaluation considers impacts on environmental sustainability, social welfare, and economic efficiency. 
The results indicate that small upfront co-investment can lead to substantial long-term system improvements. 
Furthermore, operators’ diversity provides significant potential for performance improvement under the proposed mechanism. 
In the Zurich–Winterthur case, we examine the influence of bargaining power and strategic exploitation, showing that these factors strongly impact both individual benefits and the willingness to cooperate. 
The proposed framework provides a foundation for improving interdependent networked systems by enabling strategic cooperation among self-interested operators.

Most existing zeroth-order (ZO) approaches typically assume white-box constraints or focus on convex settings, leaving the general case of nonconvex optimization with black-box constraints largely open. We propose a control-theoretic framework for ZO constrained optimization that enforces feasibility without relying on solving costly convex subproblems. Leveraging feedback linearization, we introduce a family of ZO feedback linearization (ZOFL) algorithms applicable to both equality and inequality constraints. Our method requires only noisy, sample-based gradient estimates yet provably guarantees constraint satisfaction under mild regularity conditions. We establish finite-time bounds on constraint violation and further present a midpoint discretization variant that further improves feasibility without sacrificing optimality. Empirical results demonstrate that ZOFL consistently outperforms standard ZO baselines, achieving competitive objective values while maintaining feasibility.

  abstract= {This work presents a hierarchical optimization framework for season-level decision-making in Formula 1, combining monotone co-design with sequential optimization. By integrating component design, energy deployment, and longterm degradation within a unified structure, the approach captures both local (lap and race) trade-offs and global (seasonal) constraints. The co-design layer generates trackdependent Pareto-optimal mappings between performance and wear, which are then composed into a finite-horizon optimization problem governing component usage and replacement decisions. Applied to a hybrid-electric Formula 1 power unit, the framework determines optimal battery sizing, deployment, and replacement timing across an entire season. Results show that exploiting regulatory constraints strategically, accepting local penalties to enable global gains, can increase cumulative championship points. Furthermore, while race order does not alter the attainable total reward, it modifies the optimal control policy, illustrating the temporal coupling inherent to multi-stage decision problems. Beyond motorsport, the proposed formulation provides a general template for long-horizon resource management and co-design of complex engineering systems.},

  The municipality iteratively updates taxes, subsidies, and operational constraints using a projected two-point (gradient-free) scheme, while lower levels respond through equilibrium computations (Frank-Wolfe for traveler equilibrium; operator best responses).
  This model-free pipeline enforces constraints, accommodates heterogeneous users and modes, and scales to higher-dimensional policy vectors without differentiating through equilibrium maps.

Extensive case studies demonstrate that it reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared with open-loop baselines, while delivering significantly higher throughput under stochastic delays and agent arrivals.

  On congested warehouse benchmarks from the League of Robot Runners (LRR) with up to 500 agents, our approach improves throughput by up to 10% over the 2024 winning scheduler while maintaining real-time execution.
  The results indicate that coupling graph-structured learned guidance with tractable solvers reduces congestion and yields a practical, scalable blueprint for high-throughput scheduling in large fleets.

  title={Invariant Price of Anarchy: a Metric for Welfarist Traffic Control},
  year={2025},
  abstract= {The Price of Anarchy (PoA) is a standard metric for quantifying inefficiency in socio-technical systems, widely used to guide policies like traffic tolling. Conventional PoA analysis relies on exact numerical costs. However, in many settings, costs represent agents’ preferences and may be defined only up to possibly arbitrary scaling and shifting, representing informational and modeling ambiguities.
We observe that while such transformations preserve equilibrium and optimal outcomes, they change the PoA value. To resolve this issue, we rely on results from Social Choice Theory and define the Invariant PoA. By connecting admissible transformations to degrees of comparability of agents' costs, we derive the specific social welfare functions which ensure that efficiency evaluations do not depend on arbitrary rescalings or translations of individual costs. Case studies on a toy example and the Zurich network demonstrate that identical tolling strategies can lead to substantially different efficiency estimates depending on the assumed comparability. Our framework thus demonstrates that explicit axiomatic foundations are necessary in order to define efficiency metrics and to appropriately guide policy in large-scale infrastructure design robustly and effectively.},

  title={Distributionally Robust Imitation Learning: Layered Control Architecture for Certifiable Autonomy},
  year={2025},
  abstract= {Imitation learning (IL) enables autonomous behavior by learning from expert demonstrations. While more sample-efficient than comparative alternatives like reinforcement learning, IL is sensitive to compounding errors induced by distribution shifts. There are two significant sources of distribution shifts when using IL-based feedback laws on systems: distribution shifts caused by policy error and distribution shifts due to exogenous disturbances and endogenous model errors due to lack of learning. Our previously developed approaches, Taylor Series Imitation Learning (TaSIL) and 1 -Distributionally Robust Adaptive Control (\ellonedrac), address the challenge of distribution shifts in complementary ways. While TaSIL offers robustness against policy error-induced distribution shifts, \ellonedrac offers robustness against distribution shifts due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. To enable certifiable IL for learned and/or uncertain dynamical systems, we formulate \textit{Distributionally Robust Imitation Policy (DRIP)} architecture, a Layered Control Architecture (LCA) that integrates TaSIL and~\ellonedrac. By judiciously designing individual layer-centric input and output requirements, we show how we can guarantee certificates for the entire control pipeline. Our solution paves the path for designing fully certifiable autonomy pipelines, by integrating learning-based components, such as perception, with certifiable model-based decision-making through the proposed LCA approach.},
